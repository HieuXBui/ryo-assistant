    """
    Process audio data and return transcribed text.
    
    Args:
        audio_data: Raw audio bytes
        sample_rate: Audio sample rate in Hz
        
    Returns:
        Transcribed text string
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run specific test file
python test_voice_commands.py

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=core --cov=voice --cov=ai
```
